      <p>Image-artistic activities allowing to build the image of the Alpha
        Industries brand on the Polish market.</p>
      <p>We wanted to present brand and its history to wider target group by
        working with carefully selected people from the world of music, art
        and photography. </p>
      <p>Our tool to achieve that was customization - very hot trend right now
        that is gaining popularity every day.</p>
      <p>With individual approach to that issue, we’ve linked together
        ambassadors that have highly defined aesthetics with artist who
        would perfectly portray ambassadors’ personality and style.</p>
      <p>5 unique projects were created, which were then communicated in the
        media. </p>
