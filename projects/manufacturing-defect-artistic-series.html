        The assumption of the project was to cooperate with various artists
        whose works appeared as works of art on Levi's Trucker Jackets and then
        to present them during a unique event in a traditional art gallery.
        Each of the works has been laid out in an incorrect way, for example,
        skewed and shifted. On top of that, every jacket had a stamp informing
        that this is a production defect.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the event, the exhibition was moved to the urban space for a
        month to present it to a wider circle of people.

        <p>Photo session presenting Levi’s tracker jackets created as part of
          the Manufacturing Defect Artistic Series project. The inspiration
          for the creation of photographs was the technique of analog photography,
          which often involves various defects. The photos were created in a
          scenery reminiscent of an artistic studio.</p>
