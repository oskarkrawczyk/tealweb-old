        Illustrator Day is an interactive project of the Reserved designed around the Instagram platform, in which the recipients of the brand had the opportunity to engage in cooperation with seven artists representing various styles.
      </p>
      <p>Renata Krawczyk, Elena Ciurpina, Magdalena Szklarczyk, Beata Śliwińska, Ada Zielińska, Patryk Harise and Maciek Polak appeared in subsequent editions. Observers invited to the world of illustrators, made decisions related to creative projects on an ongoing basis. Through surveys in Instagram Stories, they chose themes, colors, textures and details to complement the work.</p>
      <p>The project ended with 14 artworks that were presented during the Targi Plakatu in the form of the "Illustrator Day" gallery. The exhibition was supplemented by a zone where the last artist, Maciej Polak, created live-work.</p>
